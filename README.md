# Amazon_Forest_Fires_Analysis
This dataset reports the number of forest fires in Brazil divided by states from 1998-2017

Context:
Forest fires are a serious problem for the preservation of the Tropical Forests. Understanding the frequency of forest fires in a time series can help to take action to prevent them.
Brazil has the largest rainforest on the planet that is the Amazon rainforest.

Inspiration:
Seeing the forest fires in the recent summer months in my home state in Uttarakhand, India, I decided to analyse the forest fires data of Brazil and the regions where they were concentrated.

Also, tried my hands with plotly for the first time! Found it to be quite interactive and more detailed oriented than matplotlib

Libraries used:
pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn

p.s. The plotply plots are rendered as png on Github, so they lose the interactivity associated with them. 
There's no other solution I have been able to find for this issue.
